### Pre-run
1. Install bun (https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
2. Clone this repo
3. cd to the repo
4. Run `bun install`
5. Replace tokens in `Access Tokens` folder after they get generated for the first time with your tokens (it is advised to use actual tokens)

### Importing old saves:
1. Obtain the saves from discord (https://discord.com/channels/1053774759244083280/1232242940391329793/1486703044094595072)
2. Put the text (.txt) files of *THE BUILDS SAVES* in the `(repo path)/db_files/saves`
2. Put the text (.txt) files of *THE PLAYER METADATA SAVES* in the `(repo path)/db_files/players`
4. after you run the app, the files will get `".processed"` added in the end (remove ".processed" if you want to import them again)
5. (optional) remove the text files if you don't need them anymore and you sure you got backups

```bash
bun run index.ts
